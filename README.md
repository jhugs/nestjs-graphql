# Intro
This is nothing more than a basic fullstack application to play around with nestjs, graphql, and the OpenbreweryDB Api.

## Install dependencies
Run an `npm install` in the root, backend, and frontend folders.

## Run the backend
In the backend folder run `npm run start`. (note: you may have to run an `npm run build first`)

## Run the frontend
In the frontend folder run `npm run start`
